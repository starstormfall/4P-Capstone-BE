From electronic appliances to computer parts, video games, manga, and more, Akihabara has it all! Today we will be looking at a selection of places in Akihabara, some well-known and others more obscure, to help give you a well-rounded tour to Tokyo's most famous pop culture center. Stepping out for the first time from Yamanote Station onto the streets of Akibabara, or Akiba for short, can be an overwhelming experience. With its neon lights, the whirring clamor of video arcades, and street vendors vying to hawk their good or services (some even dressed in maid outfits!), Akihabara is a microcosm of shopping and otaku culture that's sure to capture your imagination. Nicknamed the “electric town”, Akihabara got its moniker from the various radio parts vendors, camera shops, and electronic appliance stores that set up shop after WW2. Not long after that, computer and otaku-related stores joined the mix, giving the area the unique atmosphere it's known for today.",

          "The Tsukiji Fish Market has long been regarded as one of Tokyo's most famous tourist destinations. Tourists would flock to the site before dawn for the opportunity to witness the high stakes tuna auction in action. However, in late 2018, the Tsukiji Fish Market shut down and was relaunched in the newly built location of Toyosu Market. With this significant change, plus the fact that Tsukiji's outer market is still in action, it's fair to say that there's a little confusion about where to visit and what the current difference is between the pair. To set the record straight and to help give you a little guidance we've put together this FAQ run down on what happened, what's on offer, where to go, and why. Tsukiji's famous fish market relocated to the sleek new, facility in Toyosu on October 2018. This was after a two-year delay which was marred by lengthy negotiations, political controversy and resistance from market regulars. The move was due to several issues, including health and safety concerns, developmental constraints, and a need to adequately accommodate the country's expanding tourist economy. While Toyosu Market opened in 2018, the publicly accessible tuna auction which was previously held at Tsukiji reopened here in Toyosu in early 2019. Today it's now running as smoothly as ever. Before you hop on that early morning train to catch the auction in action, here's everything you need to know about both these very different markets.",

Lavenders are the bloom that draws admirers year after year. These beauties are at their best when they peak in mid-late July, but an assortment of varieties means that they can usually be appreciated anywhere from late June to mid-August. Featuring multiple lavender fields alongside bright rainbow rows of other blooms, this idyllic farm is set against the stunning backdrop of the Tokachi mountain ranges. Nearby, you can ride a rustic tractor-drawn carriage through the massive 14-hectare fields of Lavender East.

          "I will never forget that smell. When I close my eyes and think back to that day, I can still smell it. It will never leave me. Seventeen years ago, I visited the Sierra Nevada Brewery in Chico, California with my friends Richard and Kathleen. They went to the place a few weeks before then and had raved about how good the beer was. They said it tasted so much better fresh. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale was my favorite beer at the time so I was eager to try it at the source. Richard parked his car at the brewery's parking lot and as soon as I stepped out, that's when the smell hit me. What's that smell? I asked Richard, wide-eyed with excitement. Oh that's the smell of the hops roasting mate. I couldn't believe it. I had never smelled anything like that in my life. It smelled sweet, syrupy, and full-bodied. Like burnt caramel, except darker. And richer. I was so taken by that smell I wanted to dunk my head in whatever vat was producing that godly aroma. It smelled like heaven on earth and it's a smell I've associated ever since with breweries and the beer-making process. And true enough, the beer was incredible. Fresh off the tap, it was clean and crisp, more refreshing than any beer you can ever drink from a bottle. I still remember what I had for lunch that day too - beer-battered fish and chips. As you'd expect, it tasted amazing with the beer. I know this has little to do with the Sapporo Beer Museum. It's just that I haven't visited a brewery since then so the thought of catching that smell again here brings back many hop-py memories",

          "Deep in the heart of the Susukino neighborhood, I walk up to this place called “Ramen Shingen”. It pops up on every online list as the place for real Sapporo ramen. That's a pretty incredible claim since the entire city of Sapporo, let alone the entire Hokkaido region, is known for its miso ramen. Aside from a stray car or person transiting past once in awhile, this particular block and its establishments are lonely and vacant right now. Except for Ramen Shingen. It's a small brown-grey building, and the only thing that calls attention to it are two illuminated yellow storefront signs that spell Ramen in red Hiragana and Shingen in black Kanji. It's around 13:30 and the queue still stretches outside. The length is pretty comparable to something like Ramen Tatsuya's line during dinner time back in the ATX. It's nearing winter time in Sapporo, so I dig deeper into my trench coat to avoid the brisk zephyrs. There's quite a bit of paper signage on the doors and windows, but none of it is in English. I'm waiting behind a group of 3 men, obviously friends. Their conversation is gruff, their puffy jackets and ripped up sweats scream streetwear, and one of the friends is wearing a surgical mask as if it was an accessory. All these things quickly remind me that this is not a Tatsuya, and I am very, very far away from Texas.",

During the 17-minute ride you can get a fantastic view of nearby Osaka Bay, as well as downtown Osaka and beyond. Highlights include Kobe's Mt. Rokko and the famous Akashi Kaikyō Bridge which connects Kobe to Awaji Island. The wheel is lit up at night, often in rainbow colors, or solid colors to indicate the next day's weather forecast -orange for sunny, blue for rainy, green for cloudy. There are four gondolas featuring glass bottoms that were constructed in 2008 to celebrate 10 million visitors. Naturally, the wait time is longer for these.

Very urban, the economic capital of Kansai suffers the traditional reputation of its neighbor Kyoto. Yet, beyond the castle, Osaka still hides some beautiful spots to admire sakura trees. The banks of Okawa River are certainly a part of it. Looking more closely, our visit is just a few hundred yards from Osaka Castle. The walk stretches on 32.3 hectares around 4,700 sakura, on both sides of the river, particularly in Minami-Tenma park, but also facing the Mint Bureau, and of course with the long Kema-Sakuranomiya Park.

Shinsekai was designed as an entertainment district in the early 20th century, and originally modelled after the cities of New York and Paris. Opened in 1912, Shinsekai literally means New World and because of its modern image the area quickly became a popular tourist attraction. Shinsekai's biggest attraction has always been the Tsutenkaku Tower. The original tower built in 1912 was designed to resemble the Parisian Eiffel Tower on top and the Arc de Triomphe at its base. The name “Tsutenkaku” can be translated as “Sky Route Tower” and at 64 meters high it was the 2nd biggest structure in Asia at the time. It became a symbol of pride for Osaka and people flocked to see it. Visitors were also able to take cable-car rides on an aerial ropeway that linked the tower with the Luna Park fairground. This first tower was badly damaged by a fire in 1943, and disassembled shortly afterwards. In the post-war years however, local people campaigned for a new tower to replace it and the current tower was built in 1956. Standing at 103 meters tall it was designed by the architect Tachu Naito, who also designed Tokyo Tower.",

Taiwanese shaved ice with a big pudding. This pudding is rich and plump and delicious. There are plenty of azuki beans on the ice and inside, and the texture is the best. Excellent compatibility with shaved ice. Delicious to the last bite. The ice itself is rough and large size. We all ate it on our own, but it might be just the right amount for two people to share.",

The much-talked-about Korean lunch is a set of soup and meat bowl. You can choose from two types of soup, and choose from yukgejang or tail soup.Harami bowl is packed with refreshing meat that feels like roast beef. There is no rare feeling in meat. There is a lot of rice in the size of a rice bowl. I ordered a normal serving, but if you can eat a lot, you may want to order a large serving. Popular with women because the meat is not heavy. Soup in a big bowl is delicious. Yukgaejang soup and rice went well together. Yukgaejang is quite spicy, so if you don't like spicy food, tail soup might be better.",

You can order different sizes for your udon bowl. They give you chopsticks and a spoon to drink the soup, and a paper bib to prevent you from stains. Waiters refill your glass of water when it's empty. You can pay with card",

They use Japanese high grade rice and you can see how they cook rice right in front of you. The rice is all you can eat, they also have all you can eat pickles. I had side dish kimchi and it was fresh and delicious. They cook burger in their live kitchen, you get your own grill to keep your burger warm or cook a little bit more well done. They give you 1 burger at a time so that your burger does not get cold. The burger is well seasoned and really tasty on its own, but they have so many seasonings and different sauce for you so it is fun to try different seasonings ever bite. We tried raw egg on rice and surprisingly enjoyed it as well. Overall such a good meal with super affordable price. I would recommend everyone to go, they always have wait list, I recommend to go early and get yourself on the waitlist, come back later.",

Upon closer inspection I saw that it was indeed a curry rice restaurant. If I've learned something in Japan, at the front of every long line is usually some amazing food, so I made a mental note to return. Today I returned and stood in line for around an hour at 2 pm. It was an odd experience, but what Kashmir Curry & Rice lacks in appearance they make up for in the delicious food served. This stuff is genuine, you walk into a kitchen restaurant with 8 seats and single handedly operated by one man. He has three stoves where he freshly cooks each and every plate. It's an impressive sight but the reason the line moves so slow. It's worth it though, every last drop of the curry is incredible. There are only a handful of menu options, I had the beef curry which was a little bit spicy and oh so delicious. As I'm writing this review, my mouth is salivating thinking of the dish... I will be returning to try some other menu options no doubt. The owner/cook was very nice, he could speak decent enough English which was helpful to order. He didn't do a lot of small talk and was focused on preparing each meal to its perfection.",

To describe this ramen in one word, it is “transparency”. Especially the soup has a very clear taste at the first bite. The soy sauce, which is well-behaved, creates a deep richness with a smooth texture.This is a famous restaurant that you should be prepared to wait for.",
